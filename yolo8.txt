Train YOLOv8 Object Detection on a Custom Dataset 

yolov8 -
 task - object detection,image segmentation , image classification 
  modes 3 (train ,val,predict)
 task 3(detect,segment,classify)

->through roblow you get credentital of your dataset 
->we can use terminal or jupyter 
->now just move to google collab notebook ; 
-> make sure gpu is running 
->install ultralytics 
->roboflow sdk 
->training in custom dataset 
!yolo task=detect mode=train model=yolov8n.pt data=/content/sign-languagee-7/data.yaml epochs=5 imgsz=640
//runs folder created with detect folder it include everuthing like training logs
